CHANGELOG - Database Security Updates
=====================================

Date: 2025-06-20
Purpose: Fix database security issues to enable application functionality

## CHANGES MADE:

### 1. Row Level Security (RLS) for Sources Table
**File:** supabase/migrations/20250607000000_fix_sources_rls.sql
**Issue:** Sources table was missing RLS policies, causing 403 Forbidden errors
**Fix:** Added RLS policies to ensure users can only access their own sources
**Security Impact:** IMPROVED - Users are now properly restricted to their own data

Policies added:
- SELECT: Users can only view sources in their own notebooks
- INSERT: Users can only create sources for notebooks they own
- UPDATE: Users can only update sources in their own notebooks
- DELETE: Users can only delete sources in their own notebooks

### 2. Missing User Profiles
**File:** supabase/migrations/20250607000001_fix_missing_profiles.sql
**Issue:** User profiles weren't being created, causing foreign key violations
**Fix:** Created profiles for existing users and reinforced the trigger
**Security Impact:** NEUTRAL - This is a data integrity fix, no security implications

### 3. Edge Function Storage Access
**File:** supabase/functions/process-document/index.ts
**Issue:** Function tried to access private storage with public URLs
**Fix:** Changed to use signed URLs with 1-hour expiration
**Security Impact:** IMPROVED - Files now require authentication and expire

Original code attempted:
```
/storage/v1/object/public/sources/${filePath}  // Would fail on private bucket
```

Changed to:
```
createSignedUrl(filePath, 3600)  // Secure, time-limited access
```

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT:

✅ **No Security Degradation** - All changes maintain or improve security:

1. **RLS Policies**: Properly restrict data access to authenticated users
2. **Signed URLs**: More secure than public URLs, with time limits
3. **Profile Creation**: Only affects data integrity, not security

## RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Monitor Edge Function Logs**: Check for any unauthorized access attempts
2. **Review N8N Webhook Security**: Ensure NOTEBOOK_GENERATION_AUTH is properly configured
3. **Regular Security Audits**: Periodically review RLS policies as features evolve

## ORIGINAL vs CURRENT STATE:

### Original Issues:
- Sources table had no RLS (any authenticated user could access any source)
- Storage URLs were attempting public access on private buckets
- Missing profiles prevented notebook creation

### Current State:
- Sources table properly secured with user-based RLS
- Storage uses authenticated, time-limited signed URLs
- Profile creation ensures referential integrity

All changes follow Supabase security best practices and improve the overall security posture of the application.

## ADDITIONAL CHANGES:

### 4. Documentation and Automation Scripts
**Files Added:**
- CLAUDE.md - AI assistant guidance for Claude Code
- deploy-functions.sh - Batch deployment script for edge functions
- set-supabase-secrets.sh - Secret configuration helper script

**Purpose:** Improve developer experience and deployment consistency
**Security Impact:** NEUTRAL - Documentation and automation only

### 5. Edge Function JWT Configuration
**File:** supabase/config.toml
**Changes:** Added JWT verification settings for edge functions
```toml
[functions.generate-notebook-content]
verify_jwt = true

[functions.send-chat-message]
verify_jwt = true

[functions.process-document]
verify_jwt = true

[functions.process-document-callback]
verify_jwt = false  # Intentional - called by N8N with different auth

[functions.process-additional-sources]
verify_jwt = true
```
**Security Impact:** IMPROVED - Enforces authentication on most functions
**Note:** process-document-callback intentionally skips JWT as it uses N8N authentication

### 6. Webhook URL Corrections
**Issue:** N8N webhook URLs had double slashes (//webhook/)
**Fix:** Corrected to single slash (/webhook/)
**Security Impact:** NEUTRAL - Fixing malformed URLs

## SUMMARY OF ALL CHANGES:

1. **Security Fixes Applied:**
   - ✅ RLS policies for sources table
   - ✅ JWT verification on edge functions
   - ✅ Signed URLs for storage access
   - ✅ Profile creation trigger reinforcement

2. **Developer Experience Improvements:**
   - ✅ Deployment automation scripts
   - ✅ Secret management helper
   - ✅ Comprehensive documentation

3. **Configuration Updates:**
   - ✅ Edge function security settings
   - ✅ Webhook URL corrections

## FINAL SECURITY ASSESSMENT:
All changes maintain or improve security. No vulnerabilities were introduced. 
The application is now properly secured with user-based access controls and authenticated storage.
